//! crucible, run the way a person runs it, and asserted on the screen it drew.
//!
//! Every other test in this tree sees rows. That is the right shape for a
//! component — a row is what it returns — but it means nothing above them ever
//! sees the arithmetic that turns rows into a screen: how far a frame rewinds,
//! where the cursor parks, how tall the live region is allowed to be. crucible
//! writes escape sequences inline into the terminal's own scrollback and owns no
//! cell buffer, so that arithmetic is the renderer, and it has been wrong in a
//! shipped release: the live tail was bounded by the whole window while rows
//! stood under it, so once an answer filled the screen every frame erased rows
//! the terminal had already taken, and the box was eaten away from the top as
//! the answer got longer. No component test could have caught it. This one can.
//!
//! So: a real pseudo terminal, the real binary, real keystrokes, and a
//! [`screen`] that understands exactly what the renderer promises to write and
//! reports anything else by name. Each case snapshots the picture, and every
//! frame on the way to it is checked for the two guarantees crucible makes
//! about the screen rather than about a row — that no row is ever wider than
//! the terminal, and that nothing ever moves the cursor above the top of it.
//!
//! Linux only, and the reason is in [`window`]: the child needs this pty as its
//! controlling terminal or it reads the developer's window size instead of this
//! one, and claiming a controlling terminal without `unsafe` means handing the
//! job to `setsid --ctty`, which is util-linux. Nothing about the renderer is
//! Linux-specific; the way to watch it is.
#![cfg(target_os = "linux")]
// This is test code all the way down, but the exemption `clippy.toml` grants
// tests reaches only the body of a `#[test]` function, and the pty, the child
// process and the settle loop all live in helpers beside them. A failure here
// is meant to stop the case that met it, and a `Result` threaded back to every
// case would say less about what went wrong than the message on the `expect`.
